# Audio File Placeholder

This directory should contain an `audio.mp3` file for the song.

For the demo, you can:
1. Add any MP3 file and rename it to `audio.mp3`
2. Or use a sample audio file from the internet
3. The app will show an error if the audio file is missing, but the lyrics will still display

The lyrics are already configured and will sync with any audio file you place here.
